# 👋 Hi, I’m Gunjan Shinde

🎓 I’m a recent **BCA graduate from Christ University** with a strong interest in building **AI systems that create real-world impact**. I’m particularly drawn to projects that blend technology with purpose—whether that means encouraging sustainable digital habits, enhancing how machines understand uncertainty, or applying data science to human health in space.
