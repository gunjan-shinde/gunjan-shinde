### 🚀 About Me

I’m a recent **Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA)** graduate from **Christ University**, deeply passionate about how **AI and data science** can spark meaningful change.

My interests lie at the intersection of **technology, human behavior, and innovation** — whether it’s building sustainability tools or exploring the introspection of AI systems.

🔍 Currently building:
- 🔭 AI tools that *think*, *doubt*, and *learn* like humans.
- 🌍 Eco-conscious solutions that empower digital sustainability.

### 🌟 Projects That Reflect My Vision

- 🧪 **[EcoFootprint.AI](#)**  
  A sustainability-focused app to help users track and reduce their digital carbon footprint — featuring a real-time calculator, AI-generated eco tips, and a “What If” simulator.

- 🧠 **[SelfDoubt.AI](#)**  
  A conceptual deep dive into how AI models might evaluate their own uncertainty — toward creating more introspective and adaptive systems.

- 🔁 **[MetaForgetting.AI](#)**  
  Inspired by human memory, this project investigates how AI can retain, forget, and relearn information over time to support lifelong learning.

- 🧬 **[Space Health Research](#)**  
  Conducted and presented data-driven research on astronaut cardiovascular health at the **SCI 2025 Conference, Sunway University, Malaysia**.
